# Hospital Closures and Rural Access

I am interested in looking at hospital closures and access to urgent care facilities within the US.

Hospital data comes from [HIFLD open data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals?geometry=-182.07%2C7.695%2C35.899%2C56.744). Location data is from the [Census](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/centersofpop.html), where mean population centers have been calculated for block groups.


The file "distance_2018.csv" contains the closest hospital to each census tract population center. 

[This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728684/) was used as a reference in that I drew inspiration for the methods from it.
